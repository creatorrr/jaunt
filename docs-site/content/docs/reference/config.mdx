title: Configuration (jaunt.toml)
description: "Config keys and behavior."
---

Jaunt discovers the project root by walking upward from the current working directory until it finds `jaunt.toml`.

Minimal config:

```toml
version = 1

[paths]
source_roots = ["src"]
test_roots = ["tests"]
generated_dir = "__generated__"
```

Full config (all keys optional except `version`):

```toml
version = 1

[paths]
# Directories to scan for build specs (relative to project root).
source_roots = ["src", "."]
# Directories to scan for test specs (relative to project root).
test_roots = ["tests"]
# Directory name inserted into import paths and used on disk.
# Must be a valid Python identifier. Recommended: "__generated__".
generated_dir = "__generated__"

[llm]
# Supported by the CLI: "openai", "anthropic", or "cerebras".
provider = "openai"
# Model name passed to the backend (default: "gpt-5.2").
model = "gpt-5.2"
# Environment variable used for the API key (default: "OPENAI_API_KEY").
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
# Optional pass-through for OpenAI/Cerebras.
# Common values: "low", "medium", "high".
# reasoning_effort = "medium"
# Optional Anthropic thinking budget. If set, Jaunt sends:
# thinking = { type = "enabled", budget_tokens = ... }.
# anthropic_thinking_budget_tokens = 1024

[build]
# Max parallel workers for build generation.
jobs = 8
# Best-effort dependency inference (explicit deps always apply).
infer_deps = true
# Pytest marker backend for generated async tests: "asyncio" or "anyio".
async_runner = "asyncio"

[test]
# Max parallel workers for test generation.
jobs = 4
# Best-effort dependency inference for tests.
infer_deps = true
# Passed through to pytest as repeated "--pytest-args" flags.
pytest_args = ["-q"]

[prompts]
# If set, these are treated as file paths and read at runtime by the backend.
# Leave empty to use packaged defaults under src/jaunt/prompts/.
build_system = ""
build_module = ""
test_system = ""
test_module = ""
```

Notes:

- `paths.source_roots`: the CLI picks the *first existing* source root as the output base for generated build modules.
- `prompts.*` are treated as *file paths* and read at runtime by the configured backend.
- Provider SDKs are optional extras. Install `jaunt[openai]`, `jaunt[anthropic]`, or `jaunt[cerebras]` (or `jaunt[all]`).
- There is no `[mcp]` config section; MCP is started explicitly via `jaunt mcp serve`.
- `build.async_runner` controls the pytest marker selected for generated async tests.
